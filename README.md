# peggy-to-ts

Generate Typescript types for PEGjs/Peggy grammars directly from the grammar files.

Input grammar:

```peggy
a = "a" b:b? { return ["a", b]; }

b = "b" a:a? { return ["b", a]; }
```

Autogenerated types:

```typescript
type A = ["a", B | null];
type B = ["b", A | null];
```

## Usage

Exports a `TypeExtractor` object. It is used as follows:

```typescript
const typeExtractor = new TypeExtractor(grammarSourceCode);
console.log("The generated types are:", await typeExtractor.getTypes());
```

By default, the type of the first rule is the only exported rule. To export other
rules, pass in an array of `allowedStartRules` by name. E.g., `typeExtractor.getTypes(["rule1", "rule5"])`
will export the types for `Rule1` and `Rule5`.

### Providing type hints

If your grammar's actions (the things that look like `{ return ...}`) contain arbitrary
Javascript, Typescript might not be able to guess what the types for that action are. You
can provide hints to Typescript via casing using Typescript's `as` syntax. For example

```pegjs
rule = x:.* { return mySpecialFunction(x); }
```

could be refined via

```pegjs
rule = x:.* { return mySpecialFunction(x) as number[] }
```

This would allow `peggy-to-ts` to determine that the type of `rule` was `number[]`.

## Building

To build, run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

# How it works

`peggy-to-ts` uses [`ts-morph`](https://ts-morph.com/) to extract typescript types from
the grammar file. It works in stages.

1. Extract all the rules from the grammar file.
2. Rename the rules and all references to be CamelCase (if that option is set.)
3. Recursively create the type of all non-action rules (e.g. `Rule1 / Rule2` can directly turn into
   the type `Rule1 | Rule2` )
4. Guess the types of `Action` rules, i.e., the rules with Javascript return values.

Step 4. is where the hard work is. First a function is created with generic types for
each named value in the rule and function body equal to the action body. For example, consider the rule:

```pegjs
Foo = x:Bar? y:Baz { return x ? x : y; }
```

A function is created

```typescript
function tmpFunction<T_0 extends Bar | null, T_1 extends Baz>(x: T_0, y: T_1) {
    return x ? x : y;
}
```

Then, Typescript (via `ts-morph`) is asked about the function's return type. In this case it would be
`T_0 | T_1`. Then, the generic parameter types are replaced with their named types, so we arrive at

```typescript
type Foo = Bar | Baz;
```

Unfortunately, Typescript's generic types have to be eliminated from the final
result because generics in Typescript cannot be recursive. For example,

```
type A = ["a", B];
type B = ["b", A];
```

is an acceptable type, but

```
type Mixed<X,Y> = [X,Y];
type A = Mixed<"a", B>;
type B = Mixed<"b", A>;
```

is not an allowed type in typescript. So, `peggy-to-ts` goes out of its way to eliminate
generics from the types that it generates.

## Limitations

PEGjs/Peggy actions are allowed to perform arbitrary transforms. Sometimes these
transforms will result in Typescript types that are recursive in a way that Typescript
cannot handle. For example,

```pegjs
Start
    = "a"
    / "(" s:Start ")" { return s; }
```

results in

```typescript
type Start = "a" | Start;
```

Of course, we know by looking at the grammar that if the _correct_ type
is `type Start = "a"`. However, `peggy-to-ts` is not currently able to
deduce this. (If you have an idea about how to improve this case, please make a PR!)
